However, several specific requirements are only partially or not implemented: the backend uses Motoko only for appointments (not services, reviews, profile, theme, holidays, announcements), passwords are stored in plaintext in localStorage (not hashed in backend), and theme/font counts (50+ each) cannot be verified from the diff.",
